- Use `snake_case` for function names, variable names, and file names.
- Always include explicit `use` imports — avoid wildcard imports (`use foo::*`).
- Group `use` statements into standard → external → internal (crate) order.
- Prefer `Result<T, E>` return types and bubble up errors with `?`.
- Avoid using `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production logic; prefer safe error handling.
- Document all `pub` functions with `///` doc comments.
- Write small functions with single-responsibility logic.
- Use `match` or `if let` instead of excessive `.unwrap_or_else` for control flow clarity.
- Prefer `clippy` suggestions and keep the linter warning-free.
- Keep `main.rs` minimal — move logic into modules.
