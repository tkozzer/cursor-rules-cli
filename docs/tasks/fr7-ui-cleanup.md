# FR-7 â€“ UI Cleanup & Code Quality

Status: **Planned**

This workstream focuses on polishing the user interface, resolving visual inconsistencies, improving error messaging, and performing general code cleanup to enhance the overall user experience and maintainability.

## Goals

* Polish the TUI with consistent visual design and improved accessibility
* Standardize error messages and user feedback across all components
* Clean up code quality issues, reduce technical debt, and improve documentation
* Enhance keyboard navigation and add missing UI features
* Optimize performance and reduce unnecessary API calls

## Deliverables

1. [ ] Consistent UI theme and color scheme across all components
2. [ ] Improved error handling and user-friendly error messages
3. [ ] Code cleanup: remove dead code, fix clippy warnings, improve documentation
4. [ ] Enhanced keyboard shortcuts and navigation improvements
5. [ ] Performance optimizations and API call reduction
6. [ ] Comprehensive UI testing and accessibility improvements

## Technical Tasks

### 1. UI/UX Polish

- [ ] ðŸ›  Standardize color palette and ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] ðŸ›  Improve loading states with consistent spinner animations and timing
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add keyboard shortcut help panel (accessible via `?` key)
- [ ] ðŸ›  Implement breadcrumb navigation with proper truncation for long paths
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add visual indicators for file types beyond current icons (e.g., syntax highlighting hints)
- [ ] ðŸ›  Improve selection highlighting and focus indicators

### 2. Error Handling & User Feedback

- [ ] ðŸ›  Standardize error message format and tone across all modules
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add contextual help text for common error scenarios
- [ ] ðŸ›  Implement non-blocking toast notifications for non-critical warnings
- [ ] ðŸ›  Improve network error recovery with retry mechanisms
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add progress indicators for long-running operations (manifest parsing, large file downloads)
- [ ] ðŸ›  Implement graceful degradation when GitHub API rate limits are hit

### 3. Code Quality & Documentation

- [ ] ðŸ›  Audit and fix all remaining `clippy` warnings across the codebase
- [ ] ðŸ›  Remove unused imports, dead code, and commented-out sections
- [ ] ðŸ›  Improve module-level documentation (`//!` comments) for all modules
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add comprehensive doc comments (`///`) for all public APIs
- [ ] ðŸ›  Standardize function naming conventions and parameter ordering
- [ ] ðŸ›  Reduce code duplication and extract common utilities

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- [ ] ðŸ›  Implement smarter caching for GitHub API responses
- [ ] ðŸ›  Reduce redundant API calls during tree navigation
- [ ] ðŸ›  Optimize memory usage in large repository trees
- [ ] ðŸ›  Implement progressive loading for very large directories
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add connection pooling for concurrent file downloads
- [ ] ðŸ›  Profile and optimize hot paths in TUI rendering

### 5. Keyboard Navigation Enhancements

- [ ] ðŸ›  Add support for page up/down navigation (`Page Up`/`Page Down` keys)
- [ ] ðŸ›  Implement jump-to-parent directory shortcut (e.g., `..` or `Backspace`)
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add search functionality within current directory (`/` to search)
- [ ] ðŸ›  Support multiple file selection with visual feedback (`Space` to toggle)
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add bookmark functionality for frequently accessed paths
- [ ] ðŸ›  Implement history navigation (back/forward through visited directories)

### 6. Accessibility & Testing

- [ ] ðŸ›  Ensure screen reader compatibility and proper ARIA-like semantics
- [ ] ðŸ›  Test with reduced color palettes and high contrast modes
- [ ] ðŸ›  Add comprehensive integration tests for TUI interactions
- [ ] ðŸ›  Implement automated visual regression testing
- [ ] ðŸ›  Test keyboard-only navigation workflows
- [ ] ðŸ›  Validate proper cleanup on unexpected termination (Ctrl-C, SIGTERM)

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Improvements
- **Theme System**: Centralize all UI styling in `src/ui/theme.rs` with configurable color schemes
- **Error System**: Create unified error handling with consistent formatting in `src/errors.rs`
- **Performance Profiling**: Add optional telemetry to identify bottlenecks
- **Testing Framework**: Enhance PTY testing with more comprehensive scenarios

### UI Components to Polish
- **File Browser**: Improve visual hierarchy and information density
- **Progress Bars**: Standardize appearance and ensure proper cleanup
- **Help Modal**: Create comprehensive, searchable help system
- **Status Bar**: Add more contextual information and shortcuts
- **Error Banners**: Implement dismissible, non-intrusive error display

### Code Quality Targets
- **Documentation Coverage**: Achieve 100% public API documentation
- **Clippy Compliance**: Zero warnings on all lint levels
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% coverage across all modules
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response time for all UI interactions
- **Memory Usage**: Optimize for repositories with 10,000+ files

## Acceptance Criteria

* All UI components follow consistent visual design patterns
* Zero `clippy` warnings when running `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
* Error messages are helpful and actionable for end users
* Keyboard navigation is smooth and intuitive across all screens
* Application handles edge cases gracefully (network failures, large repos, etc.)
* Performance remains responsive with large repositories (5,000+ files)
* All public APIs have comprehensive documentation
* Integration tests cover major user workflows

## Quality Metrics

- **Visual Consistency**: All UI elements use standardized spacing, colors, and typography
- **Performance**: UI remains responsive (<100ms) during all interactions
- **Accessibility**: Passes automated accessibility testing tools
- **Code Quality**: Achieves minimum 8.5/10 rating in code quality metrics
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of all identified error scenarios
- **Memory Efficiency**: Memory usage scales linearly with repository size

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Configuration file for custom themes and key bindings
- Plugin system for custom file type handlers
- Advanced search with regex and filters
- Integration with external editors
- Cloud sync for bookmarks and preferences
