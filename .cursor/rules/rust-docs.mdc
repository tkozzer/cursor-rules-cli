- Every `pub` function, struct, enum, and trait should have a `///` doc comment.
- Use Markdown syntax in doc comments to format examples and lists.
- Prefer code examples in doc comments for public APIs.
- Top-level modules should begin with a `//!` module-level description.
- Use `#[doc(hidden)]` only for internal APIs not meant for consumption.
- Keep `README.md` updated with installation, usage, and contribution sections.
- Include CLI example usage in `README.md` for quick access.
- Add `badges` for crates.io, docs.rs, and CI status to the top of the `README.md`.
- Include a `LICENSE` file and mention license clearly in `Cargo.toml`.
