- When adding a new crate (Rust dependency), always use the `cargo add` command.
- **By default, always use the latest stable version** unless the user explicitly requests a specific version.
  ```bash
  cargo add anyhow
  ````

* Only add an explicit version (e.g., `@1.0`) if:

  * The user asks for a specific version
  * A compatibility issue requires it
* For crates with optional features, include them using:

  ```bash
  cargo add inquire --features fuzzy
  ```
* Group related crate additions in a single command when appropriate:

  ```bash
  cargo add console indicatif walkdir
  ```
* Prefer `cargo add` over manual edits to `Cargo.toml` to ensure proper formatting and resolution.
* For development/test-only dependencies, use the `--dev` flag:

  ```bash
  cargo add rstest --dev
  ```
* After adding dependencies, always verify with:

  ```bash
  cargo check
  ```
