description: Use clippy and rustfmt for linting and formatting in all Rust files
globs:
  - "src/**/*.rs"
  - "Cargo.toml"
alwaysApply: true

- Always run `cargo clippy` before committing to check for common mistakes, inefficiencies, or anti-patterns.
- If `clippy` suggests fixes that are safe, you can auto-apply them with:
  ```bash
  cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty
  ```

* Prefer using `#[deny(clippy::all)]` and `#[warn(clippy::pedantic)]` in `main.rs` or `lib.rs` to enforce stricter checks.
* For formatting, always run:

  ```bash
  cargo fmt
  ```

  This ensures all code follows standardized Rust style rules.
* If a file consistently triggers clippy warnings that aren't actionable, consider annotating with:

  ```rust
  #![allow(clippy::<warning_name>)]
  ```

  but document why the warning is ignored.
* The `rustfmt.toml` file should be respected if present. Assume formatting preferences come from it.
* Never leave `clippy` or `rustfmt` warnings unresolved in production code.
